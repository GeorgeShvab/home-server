Repo for my home server.
Few weeks ago I found out I have static ip, so I took my old tablet and installed linux, so i can use it as server that runs all day long and hosts smth.  
Currently, I did simple app that sends weather info on my phone as push message each hour.
I also thought of hosting postgres db for my projects, so I could run e2e tests and build for projects with SSR.
